<h2 id="equalize-plugin">Equalize</h2>


### Features
This __equalization script__ will work with any responsive classes your heart desires to use. It will take elements and measure their position top and add them to an array. Then it assigns the tallest height to that row, so they all are sized per row neatly. You can stop it at certain widths, you can start it, and there are other configurable options. If the equalize items are all in one column rows then no heights will be added. Look at the __Settings__ for the rest.

### Settings

Option | Type | Default | Description
------ | ---- | ------- | -----------
equalizeItem | string | '.equalize' | The class of the the item to be equalized
startWidth | number | 0 | The width to start the plugin's equalization process
stopWidth | number |  480 | The width in which it stops equalizing. Perhaps you have just one column, your not going to need to equalize anything!
timerDelay | number |  100 | The throttling delay on the resizing of the window/element. May need to be adjusted if other corresponding scripting is going on.
useHeight | boolean |  false | Set to __true__ will use 'height' instead use 'min-height' with css.
useMargin | boolean |  false | Calculates in 'margin' and applies to the height
aligningCss| string |  'flex-l' | This is the class that lines up the containers for equalization. Other classes that do the same thing can be used. That or if you set up an inline-block class as well to line them up.
resizeCss| string |  'in-resize' | Transition effects will destroy equalization in certain scenarios, so this removes the transition while its being resized
fuzzy| number |  1 | The variance it can have so it doesn't need to be exactly aligned per pixel. So if an element is off by 1px it'll still align.
